<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I lay</span> no claim to literary attainments, but undertake to tell
in simple words the story of my experiences, hardships and
sufferings, lying out in the cold weather many nights, trying to
make my way across the mountains and rivers to Kentucky,
where the Union Army was encamped.</p>

<p>There have been a number of books written since the Civil
War, dealing with the loyalty, heroism and suffering of the Union
people of East Tennessee during that period, but few men have
given their individual experience from 1861 to 1864.</p>

<p>I am, so far as I can ascertain, the only East Tennessee pilot
living. I give the following names of those who piloted Union
men through the lines: Daniel Ellis, James Lane, A. C. Fondren,
James Kinser and David Fry. These men have all died since
the War, except James Lane, who was killed at the foot of the
Cumberland Mountain, in Powell’s Valley, while conveying men
to Kentucky.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I was</span> born in Greene County, Tennessee, near the banks of
the Nola Chucky River. My father moved in 1845 to the
banks of the French Broad River, in Cocke County, Tennessee,
shortly after I was born. I was the oldest of the six children,
namely, myself, Alexander, Laura, Creed, Mary and James Ragan.
My father was a county officer for years—in fact, until the late
war. I grew up in the county, and attended muster.</p>

<p>In 1860 I was elected Lieutenant-Colonel of the Militia, and
in the Fall of 1861 was in the employ of Frank Clark, who fattened
hogs and every year drove them to South Carolina markets.
At that time there were no railroads in East Tennessee
leading to South Carolina. When we left East Tennessee there
was no talk of war, but when we reached South Carolina, the
people were excited and in a state of rebellion. Before reaching
Spartanburg, Mr. Clark told me to be careful how I talked.
He seemed to know the situation.</p>

<p>After we arrived at Spartanburg I was sick with jaundice
for a few days, and confined to my bed. While in bed I could
hear the rebels hallooing and riding through the streets, and the
rattling of sabers.</p>

<p>In a few days I got out of my bed and went out into the
streets. I was young, and hardly knew what it meant, for everything
was calm when I left East Tennessee; but when I looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
up and saw the rebel flag, I felt a thrill of patriotism run through
my veins, and then began to realize the fact that it was not the
flag I had been used to all my life. At that moment I was a
Union boy, and felt that I was in the wrong latitude.</p>

<p>If I had uttered a word against the South at that time I
would have been hung to the first limb. The Negroes were excited
and scared nearly to death. Some one would set a house
on fire and accuse a Negro of the crime, and arrest the first one
he came across, taking him out and hanging him. I saw two
hung in this manner.</p>

<p>The next morning I said quietly to Mr. Clark, “I believe I
will go back to East Tennessee.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said.</p>

<p>I had, I think, the best saddle horse in the State; he was a
fox trotter, only three years old, and his gait was smooth and
easy. I bid Mr. Clark good-day, and started on my journey.</p>

<p>The farther I got from Spartanburg, the better I felt. I believe
I rode sixty-two miles from early in the morning until dark.
It seemed to me that the horse was a Union animal, for he
“pulled for the shore.” I never put a spur or whip to his flesh.
I was young, and will confess I was afraid the rebels were after
me.</p>

<p>When I reached the top of the Blue Ridge, I looked back
and it seemed to me that I could see the smoke of war. I then
turned my face toward East Tennessee, and imagined I could
see peace and harmony. I looked to my right and could see the
Holston and Watauga Rivers running down through the valleys
of East Tennessee, and the people going about their daily avocations;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
and next was the Nola Chucky, where I was born, with
her beautiful bottom lands extending for miles. Next came the
French Broad, on the banks of which I was raised. Next was
the Big Pigeon, which was made from the little streams gushing
from the Great Smoky Mountain and the North Carolina Mountains.
I imagined I could see all these rivers making their way
in peace to the Tennessee River, which emptied into the Ohio
above its junction with the great Mississippi. I did not think
at that time that there were preparations being made by the
North and the South for the greatest war that was ever fought
in the world.</p>

<p>After I had rested on the top of this mountain, I continued
my journey down through a part of North Carolina to Paint
Rock, and then into East Tennessee. When I arrived at Newport,
Cocke County, I found the people making preparations to
sow wheat. I remember on my way from South Carolina I came
to a farm on the banks of the French Broad. The men were
plowing, some with mules, some with horses and others with
yokes of oxen, turning over the land. They knew me, and asked
how I had come out with my hogs, and how the times were over
in South Carolina.</p>

<p>I said, “H— is to pay over there; they are fixing for war.”</p>

<p>They asked me who they were going to fight.</p>

<p>“The Yankees,” I said.</p>

<p>I told them that Fort Sumter had been fired upon. They
asked me where Fort Sumter was. You see that the people in
that locality had never heard of war, but in a short time they
began talking about secession.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> February, 1861, the State of Tennessee voted against
secession by the overwhelming majority of 68,000; but a
military league, offensive and defensive, was entered into on the
seventh day of May, 1861, between commissioners appointed
by Governor Harris, on the part of the State of Tennessee, and
commissioners appointed by the Confederate government, and
ratified by the General Assembly of the State, whereby the State
became a part of the Confederate States to all intents and purposes,
although an act was passed on the 8th of June for the
people to decide the question of separation and representation
or no representation in the Confederate Congress.</p>

<p>In the meantime, troops had been organized and made preparations
for war. The election was a farce, as the State had
already been taken out of the Union and had formed an alliance
with the other States of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>The leaders of the Union element, comprising the best talent
of East Tennessee, had not been idle. The most prominent
Union leaders at that time were Andrew Johnson, Thomas A.
R. Nelson, W. B. Carter, C. F. Trigg, N. G. Taylor, Oliver P. Temple,
R. R. Butler, William G. Brownlow, John Baxter and Andrew
J. Fletcher. These men, with all their eloquence and ability,
failed to accomplish the task of holding Tennessee in the Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>The State commenced organizing troops, and as Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Militia I was urged by the leading rebels of my
county to make up a regiment for the rebel army. I refused to
do so, and from that time on I was considered a Union man.</p>

<p>I was appointed by the School Board to teach school. When
the Legislature met a law was passed exempting certain persons,
such as school teachers, blacksmiths and millers from the Confederate
service. Of course I came under the law and was exempt,
and I wanted to keep out of the rebel army. I had just
married and did not want to go North and leave my family
until I was compelled to go. At that time very few men had
left the State for the North.</p>

<p>In a short time the exemption law was repealed, and every
man from eighteen to forty-five years of age had to join the rebel
army or be conscripted. I was teaching school, but did not know
of the repeal of the law; so in a day or two the rebel soldiers
came to the school house and arrested me, and took me by way
of my home, which was about two miles from the school house,
in order that I might see my wife, as I requested.</p>

<p>When we reached my home my wife came to the door, and
did not display any excitement. She was a brave Union woman,
and knew that they had a hard customer, and that I would never
fight for the Southern Confederacy. I wanted to have a private
conversation with my wife, but they refused. I did not know
when I would return, for they were killing men by
hanging or shooting them every day, and taking others to Tuscaloosa.
I just told my wife to go to her father and remain with
him until I returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>I will here relate a little incident that occurred while under
arrest that evening, showing the way the rebels treated Union
men. My brother-in-law was a rebel, but a nice man personally.
He lived on a farm of about one hundred acres, adjoining
the farm I lived on, and I can safely say that there was a cross-fence
every two hundred yards through his farm, and no bars
or gates to go through. I was on foot, and the rebel soldiers put
me in front to lay down all these fences for them to pass through,
and made me put them up afterward. Of course I obeyed orders,
for every man was armed and wanted me to do something
that they might have an excuse to shoot me.</p>

<p>When we passed out of the field into the woodland, we had
to go through a deep hollow. When we reached the place, it was
dark, although in the daytime. About the time we reached the
middle of the hollow one of the soldiers, in a low voice, said to
another, “Dave, this is a good place!” I listened, expecting to
hear the command, “Halt!” but no reply was made to the remark.
No one can imagine how I felt. I had just left my wife
standing in the door of our little log cabin, watching the soldiers
driving me through the field, taking down and putting up all the
fences, as heretofore stated; I thought of my mother and my
sisters, whom I should probably never see again. This was all in
about a minute of time, but it was a terrible minute for me.
However, the soldiers continued to drive me along until we came
in the evening to the home of Henry Kilgore, the conscript officer,
which was about two miles from our home. He took my
name, and registered it on the conscript rolls. I was then considered
a rebel soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>It was dark when we arrived at his house, and we had to
remain until morning. There was a bed in the corner of the
cabin, and I believe some beds on the second floor. The kitchen
was about ten yards from the log cabin. They gave me my
supper, but I had little appetite. I had known the conscript
officer all my life, but he did not recognize me, and I will speak
of him further on.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock I found they were going to have a
“hoe-down” that night, and the men and women of the neighborhood
were invited to come. They began to arrive about nine
o’clock. I pretended to be sleepy, and an officer who was guarding
me ordered me to get into the bed in the corner of the cabin.
Of course I was under orders, and I crawled in—but no sleep
for me.</p>

<p>They had a man with a violin, and commenced dancing,
four at a time, face to face—a general hoe-down. They kept
their drinks in the kitchen, which they visited often. They began
to get tired and commenced singing</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I want some more of your weevilly wheat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I want some more of your barley.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They danced and enjoyed themselves by running around in
the house after each other, and the women would jump on my
bed and trample over me. I thought at times I would be trampled
to death, but I was pretty hard to hurt at that time and I
was mad to the core.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Next</span> day the soldiers got together and detailed three men
to take me to Knoxville, Tenn. When we arrived there,
about two o’clock in the morning, they took me out—I cannot
tell where—and put me in the stockade with about three hundred
poor ragged men who had declared themselves for the
Union. When I went in, they raised a howl,</p>

<p>“There is another Lincolnite!”</p>

<p>I never saw such a sight in all my life. These men were
half naked and barefooted, and some without hats. They had
lost their apparel in the woods, trying to make their escape. I
do not think they had washed their faces or hands since being
captured.</p>

<p>In the morning a wagon drove up to the stockade, on the
outside, and the driver commenced throwing old, poor beef over
the stockade on the ground. I shall never forget seeing one of
the men pick up a piece of beef and throw it against the wall
to see if it would stick, but it was too poor. I never expected
to eat or bite of it, and I never did.</p>

<p>My father, who was a cousin of John H. Reagan, Postmaster
General of the Southern Confederacy, was on hand at Knoxville
about the time I arrived. He telegraphed to Richmond that his
son was under arrest, that he had committed no crime, and that
he was a school teacher. The Richmond authorities telegraphed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
back to Leadbeater, the commanding officer, directing him to
release me. The next morning I passed out of the stockade and
went back to my home, and commenced teaching school again.</p>

<p>In a few days word was sent to me that I was to be again
arrested. I then disappeared, and for about eighteen months
my whereabouts were only known by my family and the families
of my wife, father, and an old uncle. All this time I was
trying to get across to the Federal lines, but something happened
to prevent my getting away. They were scouring the country
for conscripts, and already had my name on the rolls, as I have
heretofore stated.</p>

<p>Sometime about the first of 1862 I heard that a pilot was
to be in Greene County, Tenn., to take Union men to the Federal
lines. One Joseph Smith, who lived near my town, Parrottsville,
went with me to Greene County, about twelve miles from
our home, to the banks of the Nola Chucky River, and we remained
there for a few days, lying in a straw stack and fed by
an old Union lady, by the name of Minerva Hale.</p>

<p>News came that a “pilot” would be on hand about one mile
from where we were. I do not know why, but something told
me not to go. Joseph Smith left me, bidding me good-bye, and
I never saw him again.</p>

<p>I started back home, twelve miles through the woods, and
had to cross the Nola Chucky in the dark, and the rebels travelling
all through the country, knowing that men were trying to
cross to Kentucky. I reached home before daylight and let my
wife know I had returned, then went out in the woods as usual
and put up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The next day news came to the neighborhood that the men
Joseph Smith met were captured the night he left me, only three
men making their escape—the pilot (William Worthington) and
two others. They saved themselves by jumping into Lick Creek,
a small but deep stream, and sinking themselves in the water,
only allowing their faces above the water enough to breathe.</p>

<p>The rest of the men were taken to Vicksburg and put in the
rebel army. Joseph Smith was shot in the foot while at Vicksburg,
and gangrene set in, causing his death. The other men
were never subsequently heard of.</p>

<p>I never slept in a house but three or four times during the
time I was scouting. I travelled between what is called Neddys
Mountain and Newport, Tenn., which is about twelve miles. I
never travelled in a road, and always in the night.</p>

<p>I had an old uncle who lived in Newport, between the French
Broad River and the Pigeon River, which were about four miles
apart. I wanted to see him, and started out one night. It was
dark and raining, but I always felt safer the harder it rained and
the darker the night. I came to the French Broad, a good sized
river. Of course I knew that I could not cross at the ferry, for I
had heard that it was guarded by rebel soldiers. I had been
raised in that section from a boy and was familiar with the river
and the surrounding country. About two hundred yards below
the ferry I crossed the river, wading part of the way and swimming
the balance, with my clothes in a bundle on my head.</p>

<p>When I got over I went in the bushes and dressed. I had
to be very careful, for the town was full of rebel scouts, but no
regular regiment was stationed there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>I went on the north side of the town, and down a little alley
to the back of my uncle’s house, and knocked at the kitchen
door. Directly my cousin, Sarah Ragan, came to the door, and
was dumbfounded to see me. She said, “Why, Cousin Bob, the
town is full of rebel soldiers, and two are now in the parlor!”</p>

<p>She took me upstairs, and I remained there two days and
nights. I could look out in the street and see the rebel soldiers
going up and down. Of course they thought I was in the Northern
Army, and nearly all the Union people thought the same.</p>

<p>I left the third night and went to my father’s, on the main
road leading from Newport to Greeneville, Tenn., about three
miles from Newport. This was a dangerous place for me to stop,
but I wanted to see my mother and sister, and I always found
such places about as safe for me as any, as the rebels never
thought of me or any other Union man being in such places.</p>

<p>I remained there for a few days. The second day, about
two o’clock, word came that a regiment of rebel soldiers were
crossing the French Broad at Newport, the place I had left a few
nights before. I was at a loss to know what to do.</p>

<p>A rebel family lived just a few hundred yards away, on the
main road, and there was not a tree or bush to hide me. I knew
the soldiers would stop at the house and probably search the
building for Union men. I had but a few minutes to decide.</p>

<p>My mother was on hand and always ready to offer suggestions
in time of danger. She said, “Bob, put on Laura’s dress
and sun-bonnet, and cross the road.”</p>

</figure>

<p>My sister was well grown for her age, and in a few minutes
I had the dress and bonnet on. The dress reached just below
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>my knees, but I crossed the road and passed the barn into an
old field about three hundred yards away. I fell into a washout,
and stuck my head out and saw the rebel regiment pass.
Some of them stopped at the house.</p>

<p>This was the first rebel regiment I had seen, and of course
it was a sight to me, and I felt more anxious to get to the Federal
army. This regiment of rebel soldiers was on its way to
Johnson, Carter and Cocke Counties, to look out for Union men
making their way to Kentucky or to the Federal army.</p>

<p>I went back to the house after dark, and left that night
for Neddys Mountain, in the neighborhood of my home, and
remained there some time, visiting my home at nights, but
never sleeping in the house.</p>

<p>I will here relate a little incident that occurred while on a
visit to my father’s home, at the same place where I made my
escape with the dress on. I was in the sitting room, talking to
my mother, when some one knocked at the door, Of course
we did not know who it was, so I got under an old-fashioned
bed, with curtains to the floor. Our visitor was a lady who
lived just below on the road, who was a strong rebel sympathizer,
and had two brothers in the rebel army. She had come
to spend the evening, and brought her knitting, as was the
usual custom in that neighborhood. As she was busy talking
to my mother, her ball of yarn rolled out of her lap and under
the bed. As quick as lightning, mother ran and got the ball,
by my kicking it back. In a few minutes she invited her visitor
into another room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>At another time the same lady came while I was there,
and she had a big bull dog with her. I heard that she was on
the porch, and I went under the bed again. The dog came into
the room and scented me. He stuck his head under the curtains,
and I kicked him on the nose, and he went out yelping.
The woman did not understand what it meant, but said nothing.
I left that night, and never visited my father again during
the war.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I remained</span> around home and in the mountains, waiting
for news to come for us to start for Kentucky. In a few
tidings came that a “pilot” would start for the North about the
first of May. Notice was given and preparations were made
to meet on the north side of the Nola Chucky, in Greene Co.,
Tenn. I was to meet some men at a school house, about one
mile from home. It was a dangerous time, as the rebels were
scouting all over the country for Union men. That day, about
three miles away, two Union men, Chris. Ottinger and John
Eisenhour, were killed by the rebels.</p>

<p>On the 6th of May, 1863, I was at my father-in-law’s house,
preparing to meet the party at the school house heretofore mentioned.
About sun-down, my father-in-law went to the door
on the north side of the house and, turning around, said,</p>

<p>“The rebels are coming up the lane to the house!”</p>

<p>He went out toward the barn, calling the horses, trying to
draw the attention of the rebels, and knowing that I would try
to get away. I was barefooted, bareheaded, and without a
coat. I ran out of the house on the south side, and kept the
house between myself and the rebels. I jumped over a high
fence and passed the loom house, then jumped another high
fence and lit on a lime-stone rock, cutting the ball of my left
foot to the bone, but did not know it until I ran up close to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
barn and sat down in a briar thicket in a corner of the fence.
I felt something sting, and putting my hand down, found the
blood gushing from my foot. The reader can imagine how I
felt. I was mad and ready to fight the entire Confederacy, but
sat quietly, nursing my wrath and my wounded foot.</p>

<p>By this time it was quite dark, and the rebels had fed their
horses and were going to the house for their supper which they
had ordered. I got up and studied for a moment to know what
to do, and finally decided to go back to the house the way I had
ran out. I started back, and crawled along the side of a hedge
fence on the south side of the house until I came to a gate that
opened from the kitchen. There was a bright light shining
through the window, and I could see all of the rebels seated at
the table, there being about twenty of them.</p>

<p>Outside it was very dark by this time. I crawled along on
all fours to the “big house” door and went in. The rebels had
stacked their arms in the sitting room, and all of their accoutrements
were lying on the floor. As there was no light in this
room, it was very dark. A stairway led from this room to the
second floor, and I knocked lightly on the stair railing. My
sister-in-law came in and was shocked to find me in the house.
I told her I had ruined my foot on a rock, and that I would go
round on the north side of the house to the kitchen door, and
that she should tell my wife to come out, as I wanted to speak
to her; but my sister-in-law could find no chance to do so, for
the rebels were watching the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>I stood at the door a minute, and tapped lightly, just so
my wife would hear it, for I could see through the window that
she was standing at the door. She opened it just a little, and
I whispered to her and said I would go out into the garden and
remain there until the rebels left.</p>

<p>While in the room I was tempted to take up their guns and
go to the window and shoot three or four of them, but I knew
if I did they would kill the family and burn the house.</p>

<p>I remained in the garden until they left, but suffered fearfully
with my wounded foot. I knew I had to meet the men
at the school house. After the rebels departed, I went in and
cut off the top of my shoe and washed the blood from my foot
and bound it up the best I could. The family filled my haversack
with provisions and I started for the school house, where
I met the boys and related my troubles to them.</p>

<p>Men from all parts were making their way to the place on
the north side of the Nola Chucky, some seven miles from home.
We had to cross a cedar bluff on the north side of the river, and
the night was dark and the country very rough.</p>

<p>As a man by the name of Alfred Timons was crossing the
road alone, making his way to the place, he was fired upon by
the rebels and shot through the head, the ball coming out
through his right eye. He fell to the ground, but regained his
strength and made his escape to the river, which he crossed and
came to the camp. The boys dressed his wound the best they
could, and he went to Kentucky, but lost the sight of his eye.</p>

<p>I suffered all night with my foot, and could hardly put it
to the ground. There were about one hundred and twenty men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
gathered there from all parts of the country, to go to Kentucky.
We remained there that night and until about eight o’clock the
next evening, when they started for that State.</p>

<p>I had to abandon the attempt to go this time, and was left
alone on the bluff in a terrible condition—no one to help me
back home, and if I should succeed in reaching home I could
not stay in the house. I knew if I was captured I would be shot
or hung to the first limb. The rebels had received word that
we had crossed the river and were making our way to Kentucky.</p>

<p>I started for home that night, crossing the river in a canoe
at the same place where I had crossed the night before. I travelled
about three miles that night, and just before daylight I
crawled into a barn, dug a hole in the hay, and remained there
all day, suffering intensely with my foot. Some one came into
the barn to feed the horses, but I knew who lived there, and
did not dare to make my presence known. When the person
came in the hay loft I was afraid whoever it was might stick
the pitch fork in me. I could not tell whether it was a man or
woman, for no word was spoken. I lay there all day, without
anything to eat or drink, and suffering fearfully with my foot.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock that night I crawled out of the barn
and started for home. I travelled about three miles, and before
daylight I crawled into another barn. I had known the
owner all my life. He was a German and a good Union man,
but I could not let myself be known. No one came to the barn
that morning, and I lay there all day. My foot had swollen so
badly that my shoe had to be taken off, and I had to go barefooted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>The third night I crawled into the barn of Philip Easterly,
who was my wife’s uncle. I did not let myself be known, but
lay there all day as usual, and at night crawled out, having
one mile and a half to travel to reach home.</p>

<p>I can safely say that I had to hop on one foot most of the
way. I had no crutches and nothing but a stick that I had cut
with a knife. When I arrived at my home, about three o’clock
in the morning, my folks were surprised to see me, for they
thought I could never walk on my foot in the condition it was
in. I had my foot dressed for the first time since I was hurt.
The blood had caked on it, and it looked as if amputation might
be necessary; but my wife came to me two or three times a
day and dressed it. I stayed in the barn at nights, and in the
woods in the daytime. I had to remain in this condition for
about six weeks, until I got so that I could begin to walk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> July, 1863, the news came that George Kirk would meet
some men in Greene County to take them to Kentucky. I
was determined to go, if I had to crawl part of the way. We
met in Greene County, with about a hundred men. We crossed
Walden Ridge and the Watauga, Cumberland, Holston and
Powell’s Rivers, encountering great hardships. Our provisions
gave out, and the only way we could get anything to eat was
to find a colored family. They were always loyal, and we could
depend on them. They never would “give us away.”</p>

<p>When we reached Camp Dick Robinson, Kentucky, we found
a great many East Tennessee men who had made their way
through the mountains. Some had organized into companies.</p>

<p>Col. Felix A. Reeve, who is now Assistant Solicitor of the
Treasury Department, was organizing the Eighth Tennessee
Regiment of Infantry. I reported to him that there were a
great many Union men in North Carolina and Cocke County,
Tenn., that wanted to come to the Union army, and if he would
give me recruiting papers I would attempt to cross the Cumberland
Mountain into East Tennessee, and make up a company
and bring them back with me. He was very anxious for me
to try it, but said it was a very dangerous undertaking, for the
rebel soldiers were guarding every road and path that had been
traveled by the Union men. I concluded, however, to make
the venture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>With my brother Alexander Ragan, Iranious Isenhour,
James Kinser and James Ward, I started for East Tennessee.
We crossed Cumberland Mountain, and it commenced raining,
and when in the night we came to Powell’s River it was overflowing
its banks. We had crossed at this place on our journey
to Kentucky. The canoe was on the opposite side, and the
night was so dark that we could not see across the stream. We
knew that if we remained there until daylight we certainly
would be captured and hung or shot. My brother and Eisenhour
were good swimmers. They stripped off their clothes, and
I never expected to see either of them again. I remember that
my brother, while we were talking about who should swim over
to get the canoe, said to me,</p>

<p>“I am not married, and if I get drowned it will not be so
bad; if you were to get drowned, Emeline would be left alone.”</p>

<p>I have since thought thousands of times how noble it was
in him to have such fraternal feeling for myself and my wife
under circumstances of so trying a nature.</p>

<p>They both plunged in at the same time. The timber was
running and slashing the banks on the other side. I held my
breath, waiting to hear the result. In a few minutes I heard
my brother say, “Here it is, Iranius.” So they brought the
canoe over, and one by one we crossed to the other side. It
was a frail little thing, and we thought every minute we would
be drowned. We crawled up the steep bank to an old field,
and as by this time it was daylight, we had to get into the
woods and hide for the day. We had filled our haversacks with
provisions when we left Camp Dick Robinson, but they were all
wet and mixed up; yet we ate them all the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>James Ward could not see a wink in the night. We did
not know it until we had passed Cumberland Mountain. Of
course we had to take care of him. He was like a moon-eyed
horse; he was all right in the daytime, but we had to travel in
the night, and we had to lead him half the time.</p>

<p>After a good many hardships, we reached Cocke County,
Tenn. I do not think we met any one but an old man named
Walker, whom I will mention later on. He gave us something
to eat—in fact all he had, for the rebel soldiers had robbed him
and left him destitute.</p>

<p>I went to my home in the night and made myself known,
but did not sleep in the house.</p>

<p>While I was away, the rebels came to my father-in-law’s
house and took him out to an old blacksmith shop and told him
if he did not give up his money they would hang him. He
would not tell them where the money was, and they put the
rope around his neck and threw it over the joist of the blacksmith
shop, and pulled him up by the neck. His daughter came
and agreed to tell them where the money was, and they let
the old man down, but he was so near dead that he could not
stand. They took the money, some gold and some silver, and
passed on. My father-in-law was Benjamin F. Neass, an unconditional
Union man. These things I relate to show how
Union men and families were treated.</p>

<p>In the meantime I sent for my father at Newport, whom I
had not seen for a year, and told the messenger not to let him
know who wanted to see him, but to meet me in a piece of
woodland in a certain place on my father-in-law’s farm. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
next night he came. I asked him to send word to North Carolina,
and every place where he could find out that there were
Union men who wanted to go to Kentucky, but not to let a man
know who was the “pilot.” He was Deputy Sheriff of the
county, and was exempt from going into the rebel army at that
time, but later on he had to leave the country.</p>

<p>In a few days word reached North Carolina and Greene
and Cocke Counties, Tenn., that a “pilot” would be on hand at
a place in the woods on my father-in-law’s farm at a certain
date. On the appointed day, one, two and three at a time,
they made their appearance. I did not make myself known,
but had a man ready to meet them and keep them quiet, for
the rebels were all through the country. I knew if they captured
me it would be certain death, for they killed every “pilot”
they could lay their hands on.</p>

<p>The Union women had been notified when we were to meet,
and they had made haversacks and filled them with provisions
for their husbands. The mothers and sisters had done the same
thing for their sons and brothers who were single.</p>

<p>When the time came at nine o’clock for us to start, I came
out and made myself known. There were about a hundred
men present, and I had been acquainted with nearly all of them.
They were surprised and glad to see me, and I swore in all who
wanted to enlist. It was a sad sight. The wives bid their husbands
good-bye, net knowing whether they would ever see them
again or not, and some of them never did; but they were loyal
women and were ready at all times to sacrifice all for their
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Women in North Carolina and some parts of East Tennessee
suffered themselves to be whipped, and everything taken
from them, and yet they would not tell where their husbands
were. I have known them to cut up the last blanket in the
house, to make clothes for their husbands, who were lying out,
waiting for a chance to reach the Federal army. The night I
left, my wife had cut up a blanket and made for me a shirt
and a pair of drawers. All these things go to show what the
Union men and women of East Tennessee did to help save
this Government when it was in danger of destruction.</p>

<p>We then started on the perilous undertaking, which was
more dangerous at that time than upon the previous trip to
Kentucky, for men all over East Tennessee had to leave, and
the roads and river were guarded. Nearly all the men had old
rifles or shotguns that they had rubbed up until they looked
like army rifles. We reached the Nola Chucky, about twelve
miles from our starting point, about midnight in a violent thunder
storm, in the darkest night I had ever witnessed. As the
lightning flashed we could see it run along the barrels of the
guns. The river was very high, and there seemed to be a general
war of the elements.</p>

<p>Each man had been instructed before we started to not
speak above his breath, and if possible not to break a stick under
foot. We halted in the lane in front of the house occupied
by the man who kept the ferry, who was a Union man. His
name was Reuben Easterly, six feet and two inches in height.
I went to the door and knocked; he was slow to get up, but in
a few moments came and opened the door.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i27" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>I said in a low tone of voice, “One hundred and twenty
Union men want to cross the river.”</p>

<p>He hesitated and said, “The river is up, and I am afraid
you can’t cross.”</p>

<p>I said to him, “We have to cross, dead or alive. If we remain
on this side until daylight, we will be captured and sent
to Tuscaloosa.”</p>

<p>He finally agreed to try, as he was always ready to help
Union men. He came out and about half of the men got into
the flat-bottomed boat and ran up the river a hundred yards
to get a start so as to reach the landing on the other side. We
waited some time, and heard the old boat strike dirt on the safe
side. In about half an hour the boat returned to our side, and
the balance of us got in and were soon safely landed with the
others. We asked old Reuben what he charged.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said he, “and I wish you a safe journey to the
promised land.”</p>

<p>Those kind words served to cheer us very much on our way.</p>

<p>After crossing the river we started for the Chucky Knobs,
where we were to meet several Union men. When we reached
the place, in a deep hollow, with no house within a mile, we
found fifteen men waiting for us, including Judge Randolph, of
Cocke County. A number of Union women had learned that
we were to meet at this place, and that their husbands were
going away, and they had prepared rations and haversacks to
supply them on their dangerous journey. They bid them good-bye,
and two of them never saw their husbands again.</p>

<p>We remained there all that day, and that night at eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
o’clock we started for good, with about one hundred and thirty
men. All seemed to be in good spirits and glad that they were
on their way to the “promised land,” as Reuben Easterly said
when we crossed the Nola Chucky. We travelled about fifteen
miles that night, and next day laid in the woods on the banks
of the Watauga River.</p>

<p>When night came we crossed the river—some swimming
and some crossing in an old canoe—and continued our journey.
At daylight we came to the Holston River, at a point where no
Union men had previously crossed on their way to Kentucky.
I sent three men up the river to find a canoe, for some of the
men could not swim and it was too deep to wade. They found
an old canoe, and while some swam and others crossed in the
canoe, it was nearly midnight when we all got across.</p>

<p>As the men reached the opposite side, they would lie down
and go to sleep while the others were crossing. It was a level
place on the opposite side, and stick weeds had grown up about
five feet high. When the men had all crossed, they woke up
those that were asleep, and we got in line and started. After
travelling about half a mile, we heard some one howling at the
top of his voice. I sent two of the boys back in haste to find
out what was the matter. They found that Jimmie Jones was
left asleep on the bank of the river, the boys having failed to
awaken him. He said that he dreamed that the rebels were
after him and he woke up and found we had gone, and the old
man commenced howling like a lost dog. We were very uneasy
about it, for fear the rebels had heard him, but evidently
they had not and no unpleasant consequences resulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Next came Bays and Clinch Mountains, steep and rugged,
over which we had to pass; and then came Clinch River, another
dangerous place to cross, for the rebels were watching the
paths and the rivers to prevent Union men from leaving the
country and reaching the Federal lines.</p>

<p>We crossed Powell’s Mountain, tall, rough and rugged;
then came Walden Ridge and the Wild Cat Mountain. The
nights were so dark we could not see ten feet ahead of us. As
we passed through these dark, narrow paths, we marched in
single file, myself leading; the next one would take hold of my
coat tail, and so on down the line. No man was allowed to
speak above his breath. Sometimes men would fall and suffer
themselves to be dragged for yards, but never spoke nor murmured
a word.</p>

<p>We had some rations on hand that our wives had prepared
for us, but they were getting scarce, from the fact that we had
to keep away from houses and public roads. It was certainly
strange that one hundred and thirty men could travel through
a country two hundred miles, thickly settled in some places,
and never be seen.</p>

<p>We continued on our march, the night being very dark
and the country very rough. The men had become tired and
worn out. Some were nearly barefooted, for their shoes were
poor before they left home.</p>

<p>The next morning we came in sight of Powell’s River, and
remained in a thick piece of woods for the day. We were in a
dangerous part of the country—we were nearing Powell’s Valley,
the most dangerous place in all our travels. When night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
came we were a little refreshed, but were out of rations, and
had been living on quarter rations all the way. We crossed
Powell’s River that night, and started for the great task. We
had to cross the “Dead Line” and Powell’s Valley the next night.</p>

<p>It was so dark we could not see ten steps ahead of us, and
we lost our trail. When daylight came we found ourselves
about two miles East of the regular trail. We halted in a deep
hollow and had a consultation. I knew that I was “in for it,”
if I failed to get them out. I was sure we were East of the
home of old man Walker, the man who gave us something to
eat on our way to Tennessee on our previous trip, and I thought
I could find his house. I started West, and travelled two miles
through the woods, in a rough country, with no houses near.
It so happened that I came out of the woods at the rear of his
house. I lay down in a patch of chinkapin bushes for some
time, as I was not certain that I was at the right place, the
house being a very ordinary log building.</p>

<p>I crawled to a low rail fence, and knocked on a rail of the
fence with a small stone. In a moment Walker came out of
the house, looking like a wild man, and seemed to know what
was up. He went back and in a few minutes a company of
rebel cavalry passed along the road. I waited until they got
out of the way and then knocked again and he came out the
second time.</p>

<p>He came slowly to where I lay, and said, “What’s the matter?”
He recognized me, for it had been but a short time since
we had a talk with him on our way from Kentucky to Tennessee.
I told him that about one hundred and thirty men had got
off the trail and had wandered about two miles East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>He said, “Don’t say a word; there have been several such
cases.” He told me to go back in the thicket and not make
any noise, for the rebels were travelling up and down the road;
and he would bring the men out in a short time. In about two
hours Walker returned, with the men trailing after him. I
never saw men so happy, for they knew if they had remained
there they would be captured and sent to Tuscaloosa.</p>

<p>We were all nearly starved, having eaten up all we had
the day before. I asked Walker if he could get us something
to eat. He said he did not have anything but Irish potatoes,
and they were in the ground, and some apples that were on the
trees, and nothing to make bread of. The rebels had taken
nearly everything he had. He went to work and dug the potatoes
and gathered the apples, and cooked them in some old tin
buckets, the only things available. He cooked about two bushels
each of the apples and potatoes.</p>

<p>It was about nine o’clock in the morning when he brought
the men to his place, and at noon the “dinner” was ready. I
got the men in line, and Walker passed the buckets along. As
the men had no knives, forks or spoons, they had to use their
hands, and some of them were so hungry that they burned
their fingers in their eagerness to partake of the delicious and
inviting repast. Our generous host continued to supply them
until all was consumed.</p>

<p>The men were so famished that while he was cooking the
apples and potatoes they peeled the bark off all the little trees
and ate it. The whole thicket, about an acre, looked white after
the trees had been thus denuded of their bark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>By this time it was two o’clock in the afternoon, and I told
the men to lie down and try to sleep, for we had to cross the
“Dead Line” and Powell’s Valley that night, and get into Cumberland
Mountain, for I knew the rebels were on our trail.</p>

<p>While we were lying on the ground about three hundred
yards from the main road, we could hear the rebels riding up
and down the road. No man was allowed to make any noise.
They obtained a few hours of sleep and rest, which was very
much needed. I had two men detailed to keep them from
snoring, for some of them you could hear a hundred yards.
These men would go around and when a man would snore they
would shake him or give him a kick.</p>

<p>When night came, the perilous task of crossing the “Dead
Line,” which we had dreaded from the start, was before us.
Several men had been killed at this place during the preceding
ten days. I asked Walker if he knew a good Union man who
could be relied upon to guide us to the road. He said there
was a man in the neighborhood who had helped men to Powell’s
Valley, and he would send a colored girl to see if the man
could be found. By the time we were ready to start, about
nine o’clock, he came. I questioned him and he seemed to be
all right, so we started, he in the lead. I had been on the trail
before, and after travelling about a mile I became a little suspicious
and stopped the men. I thought we were too far West.
I formed a hollow square, with this man in the center. I questioned
him and found we were a mile off the trail. We put
the man under arrest, and went back to where we had started
and took up the right trail. I do not think this man intended
to lead us into the rebels’ hands, but he became bewildered and
scared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>We reached Powell’s Valley about three o’clock in the
morning, and halted on a little bank about ten feet above the
level of the main road leading up and down the valley, which
was called the “Dead Line.” I remember this experience as
vividly as if it were but yesterday. The woods in which we
were concealed were as dark as hell, and hell was in front of
us. There were about one hundred and thirty men standing
in single file, and I could not hear a man move or breathe.
Even death itself could never be more still.</p>

<p>The valley we had to cross was about four hundred yards
wide, and not a tree or bush in the valley. The road in front
of us was dusty, and while we stood there we heard in the distance
the rattle of sabers and the galloping of rebel cavalry.
We stood motionless as they passed by, and the dust from the
horses’ hoofs came up in the bushes and settled on our shoulders.
What a time it was for us! It seemed that we were to
cross the “Valley and shadow of death.”</p>

<p>When the rebel cavalry had passed, I cut off twenty-five
men and said, “Now, boys, go!” and they did go. They
crossed that valley like wild cattle. When I thought they
were safely over, I cut off twenty-five more men, and they also
landed safely. I waited awhile, and we could hear the rebel
cavalry coming back. They passed down again, so we waited
about ten minutes and then I said, “Boys, now follow me!”
and we all crossed in safety and were at the foot of Cumberland
Mountain, which was rough, steep, rocky and pathless.
Every man had to pick his way until we nearly reached the top.</p>

<p>As we crossed the valley, the air was filled with the stench<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
of the decaying bodies of the men who had been killed a few
days before. No one could venture to remove or bury them.
I understood afterward that they attempted to cross in the
daytime, and were killed.</p>

<p>When we reached the top of Cumberland Mountain we
came to what was called Bailes’ Meadow, a name and place
familiar to nearly every “pilot” and man who crossed the
mountain. The boys were worn out, mostly all barefooted
and nearly naked from crawling through bushes and briar
thickets.</p>

<p>Some of them, when we reached the top of the mountain,
looked back into the valley of East Tennessee and said, “Farewell
to rebellion;” and they looked North and said, “I can see
the Promised Land!” They were happy, but they had been so
long hiding in the woods that they would only speak in whispers,
and it was a long time before they could break themselves
from the habit. You could trail them by the blood from their
feet, but like brave men they marched along without a murmur.</p>

<p>James H. Randolph, of Newport, Tennessee, was with us.
I was sorry for him as well as the others. His shoes were entirely
worn out, and his feet were bleeding. I can remember
the circumstances as distinctly as though it were but a few days
ago. He looked at me and said, “Bob, when we get back to
Tennessee we will give them H—, and rub it in!” He was
mad, worn out, and nearly starved to death; but we were out
of danger and began to realize that we were free once more.</p>

<p>We went down to the settlements in Kentucky, but could
not see a man. It seemed that they had all gone to the Union<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
or the rebel army; but the farms appeared to be in good condition
and well stocked, and the fields were full of corn. We
came to a large farm at the foot of the mountain, with a large
frame house, painted white, but could not see any one. There
was quite a field of corn, just in roasting ears. We halted, and
I told the boys we must have something to eat, for we were
nearly starved. We had had nothing to eat since we ate the
apples and potatoes at old man Walker’s.</p>

<p>I told four or five of the boys to go to the corn field and
bring as many roasting ears as they could carry, and some five
or six others to go out in the pasture where there was a nice
flock of sheep and bring in a couple of fat bucks, and we would
cook the mutton with the roasting ears. In the meantime others
went to the house and got a wash kettle in which to cook
the mutton and corn, and some salt for seasoning. By the
time they returned the boys had arrived with the roasting ears.
I looked out in the pasture and saw five boys, each pulling a
sheep along. They were so hungry that they thought they could
eat a sheep apiece; but we only killed two, and they were fine.
We had men in the company who could equal any butcher in
dressing a sheep. We filled the kettle with corn and mutton,
and had a fine barbecue. We had no soap, and when the boys
got through, their mouths, faces and hands were as greasy as a
fat stand. I sent one of the boys to the house to tell the lady
how much we had taken, and ask what she charged.</p>

<p>She said, “Nothing.” Some of the boys had a little gold
and silver with them and wanted to pay her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>We reached Camp Dick Robinson in a few days, and remained
there some time. Col. Reeve had his regiment nearly
made up. We organized our company as Company K, which
about completed the regiment. The company was mustered
into the service, when the boys drew their uniforms and their
new Enfield rifles. After they had shaved, cleaned up and put
on their new uniforms, I met them several times and did not
know them. They were the happiest men I ever saw.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> army was getting ready to start on the march for East
Tennessee. I had bought my officer’s uniform, with my
straps on my shoulders and a sword hanging by my side. I do
not think that General Grant or General Sherman ever felt as
big as I did. Of course we had been lying in the mountains
of East Tennessee for nearly two years, and had been chased
by rebels and in danger of our lives every minute of our time,
and had to leave our families to be treated like thieves—why
not feel good as we were going back to relieve them? I have
known rebels to take women and whip them to make them
tell where their husbands were.</p>

<p>About the first of August we were ordered to be ready to
march at a minute’s notice, and in a few days the orders came
for us to fall in line. The band struck up the tune, “Going
back to Dixie;” the men cheered, and some shed tears of joy.
The army concentrated at Danville, Ky., and General Burnside
took command of the 23d Army Corps. We remained there a
few days, and then took up our march in fact for East Tennessee.
We had a pretty hard time getting across the mountains,
as the roads were very bad, and the horses and mules were
not used to traveling; a great many of them gave out, and a
large number died.</p>

<p>We reached East Tennessee, below Knoxville, about the
last of August, 1863, and marched in the direction of that city,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
passing between it and Bean Station. We skirmished with the
rebels on our way, and then camped at Bull’s Gap for a few days.</p>

<p>While at Bull’s Gap, I asked Col. Reeve for a detail of six
men to go across the country about eighteen miles, to visit my
home and find out if any rebels were lurking around in the
neighborhood. When we got within a mile of Parrottsville,
Cocke County, near where I lived, we sent a Union woman to
the town, requesting her to see an old colored man by the name
of Dave Rodman, who we knew had been living there all his
life, and to tell him to come out to a piece of woodland just
above the town.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock in the night we heard the old man coming
in our direction. We met him and he informed us that
Henry Kilgore (the man who conscripted me), Tillman Faubion
and Cass Turner were in the town; that Kilgore was at his
home, and the other two men were across the street at Faubion’s
house. We went into the town, and George Freshour,
who was a Sergeant in my company, and one other man and
myself surrounded the Kilgore house, while the other three
men went across the street to the Faubion house and captured
Faubion and Cass Turner. Their horses were hitched to the
fence, ready to mount and make their way to North Carolina.
It was raining, and the night was very dark.</p>

<p>Freshour went to the front door and knocked; some one
came to the door, and he asked if Kilgore was at home. They
said that he had gone. As I was at the back kitchen door and
the other man at the south door, we knew he had not passed
out. Freshour insisted that Kilgore was in the house, and demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
that the door be opened. Finally they let him in.</p>

<p>There was no light in the house. Freshour searched under
the beds and every place that he thought a man could hide
in, but failed to find his man. He then went into the kitchen
and found Kilgore crouched behind some old barrels. We
brought him out and took him across the street where the other
two prisoners were. We then started down Clear Creek, which
ran through the Knobs, and we had to cross it ten or fifteen
times on foot logs that were narrow, smooth and slippery.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Rebellion this man Henry Kilgore
was a conscript officer, and gave Leadbeater’s Command, which
was stationed at Parrottsville for the purpose of hunting Union
men, all the information he could obtain as to where the Union
men kept their corn, wheat, bacon and bee gum. He was a
terror to the country.</p>

<p>Tillman Faubion was a nice man, and I never heard of him
giving any information, but he was a strong rebel sympathizer.</p>

<p>Cass Turner lived between Sevierville and Newport, Cocke
County, Tenn. He was a conscript officer, and one of the worst
men in that section. While hunting Union men who were lying
out in the hills, trying to get to Kentucky, he found that
two or three men were hid in a cave in his neighborhood. He
and two others went to the cave and found the men, and it was
said he shot them and left their bodies in the cave.</p>

<p>I remember when we started with these three men, Sergt.
Freshour walked behind Kilgore, and he insisted upon my giving
him permission to kill Kilgore, but I would not let him do
any harm to any of the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Cass Turner was a short man, weighing about two hundred
pounds. He could not walk the foot-logs, and had to get
down and slide across on his stomach. He and Kilgore pleaded
with the boys to let them ride, but they refused.</p>

<p>About ten miles below where we captured these men we
came to the home of a Mrs. Bible, whose husband had been captured
by the rebels, taken to Tuscaloosa and died. Freshour
asked her if she had any honey, and she replied that there was
a bee hive in the barn that the rebels had not found. Freshour
went to the bee hive, took out a pound of soft honey, put
it in Kilgore’s tall white “plug” hat, and made him wear it.
The honey ran down his face, eyes and ears. The cause of the
Sergeant’s little act of “pleasantry” was the fact that Kilgore
had sent the rebels to Freshour’s father’s house, and they took
all of his bee hives, wheat, corn and bacon—in fact all he had.
The rebel now had an opportunity to taste the “sweets of adversity.”</p>

<p>We took these men to Knoxville and turned them over to
the authorities, and then returned to our command, at Bull’s
Gap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Preparations</span> were being made at Missionary Ridge for
battle, and the rebels were concentrating all their forces
at that point. Burnside’s Corps returned to Knoxville and was
besieged. After Grant defeated the rebel forces at Missionary
Ridge, Longstreet’s army came up to Knoxville and attacked
the Federal forces on the west end, but were repulsed with
great loss. Longstreet’s defeated and demoralized forces took
up their march to East Tennessee, making their way to Virginia.
Burnside’s Corps followed them as far as Jonesboro, and then
returned by way of Knoxville.</p>

<p>Grant and Sherman were getting their forces together, and
making preparations for the great march to Atlanta. Burnside
arrived at Red Clay and marched out to what is called Buzzard’s
Roost and attacked the enemy, but they were too strongly
fortified. We fell back, and Sherman commenced for the first
time with his “flanking machine,” as the rebels called it. We
marched around through Snake Creek Gap and formed in line
of battle about a half mile from the rebel breastworks, our
Division being in front. We marched down through a piece of
woodland and up a hill about two hundred yards from the rebel
works. The grape and canister would cut through our ranks,
and we would close up the gaps. It was said that there were
about five hundred pieces of artillery playing at the same time.
It seemed that the earth was tottering to the center.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>We were ordered to lie down within about one hundred
yards of the rebel breastworks. A line of battle passed over
us, a Colonel being mounted. His horse was shot from under
him, but he never halted. The horse fell and rolled down the
hill, about ten steps from our line.</p>

<p>General Sherman, knowing our condition and that we were
losing hundreds of men, moved around on our extreme right
and, getting the range of the rebel breastworks, turned loose
his artillery and plowed the rebels out of the works. They retreated,
and the day was ours.</p>

<p>When the battle was going on the cannon balls cut off the
tops of the trees, and they fell in our ranks and killed many of
our men. After the smoke of the battle had cleared away, I
could see the rebel sharpshooters hanging in the trees. They
had tied themselves to keep from falling if wounded, but some
were dead. It was reported that the rebels obtained from some
foreign country the long-range guns then used by the Southern
sharpshooters, which seemed to be superior to the rifles in possession
of our forces.</p>

<p>This little account is not intended to give the history of the
War or the exciting campaign through Georgia, but only to give
an insight into my personal experiences.</p>

<p>I will here relate one little occurrence at Cartersville, Ga.,
after we had driven the rebels across the Etowah River. I was
detailed with about fifty men to go around a mountain and
down to a large flour mill on the river, if we could, and burn it
up with all its contents. We arrived on the side of a mountain
just above the mill and halted. On the opposite side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the river was a high bluff, from which we were fired upon by
the rebels, but we sheltered ourselves behind trees.</p>

<p>I took eight or ten men and went back a few hundred
yards to a little stream that flowed into a mill race leading to
the mill. The race was quite large, and as the water overflowed
on both sides it formed a screened pathway. We reached the
mill, unseen by the rebels, and went from the basement to the
upper floor, where we found four men sacking flour and corn
meal and loading it in wagons in front of the mill. We arrested
them and ordered them to help us carry the flour and meal
back into the mill. We then unhitched the horses from the
wagons, took off the wheels and rolled them into the mill, and
then set the building on fire. When it was in full blast, we released
the men and went back the same way we came. Finding
that our men had silenced the rebels on the other side, we
took up our march back to our command and made our report.</p>

<p>We crossed the Etowah River the next day, and found the
rebels had formed a line of battle and built breastworks. We
drove the rebel picket line in, and fortified within about five
hundred yards from the enemy’s fortifications, which were on
a ridge in a piece of woodland. Our picket line was deployed
on the edge of an old field, about two hundred yards from the
rebel breastworks. There were two small log cabins between
the lines, about thirty feet apart, from which any of our men
who exposed themselves were shot. I saw several men killed
while trying to pass between these cabins. Being in charge of
the brigade picket line, I received an order to charge the rebel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
pickets and drive them into their works. I knew it was death
to every man, for I had been there all day and understood the
situation. I refused to make the charge, and one of Burnside’s
Staff—I think it was Major Tracy—rode up and said to me,
“Why did you disobey orders?” I told him if he remained
where he was he would be shot. Just then a ball struck him
in the breast, and he fell from his horse and was carried off the
field. I received no more orders, and remained in charge of
the picket line.</p>

<p>That night about twelve o’clock I heard a cow bell tinkling
in front of us, sounding as if cattle were eating leaves off the
bushes. I called the attention of Sergeant George Freshour to
it. He belonged to my company, and was as brave a boy as
ever lived. He said, “Captain, that is rebels, trying to make us
think it is cattle.”</p>

<p>He handed me his gun, and said he would crawl down in
the bushes and see what it meant. He was gone about ten
minutes, when I heard him crawling out of the bushes, nearly
out of breath, and in a low whisper he said, “Captain, the
woods are full of rebels and they are advancing!”</p>

<p>I immediately passed the word along the line to get ready
for a charge. In a few minutes I gave the order, “Charge!”
and we did charge! We drove the rebel line back into their
works, and returned to our former line. It was as dark as it
could be, and they evidently thought the whole Federal army
was after them</p>

<p>The next morning at daylight I was relieved, and we were
congratulated for our action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>About four o’clock that evening the whole rebel line charged
our works. The battle lasted about two hours, but we repulsed
them and they fell back, leaving about three hundred dead and
wounded on the field.</p>

<p>Sherman was moving on the extreme right, as usual, turning
the rebels’ left flank, and they had to leave their works and
retreat. We continued in pursuit of the enemy, skirmishing
continuously, and when we reached the front of Atlanta we
were on the extreme left near the breastworks, guarding the
wagon train.</p>

<p>About two o’clock on the afternoon of July 22, 1864, the
rebels attacked our left and drove our wagon train pell mell,
forcing our left wing back. General James B. McPherson came
up with his Staff, rode out through a piece of woodland in front
of us, and ran into the rebel cavalry and was killed. I was
within thirty yards of him at the time.</p>

<p>In about a half-hour General John A. Logan came up and
took command. The evening after General McPherson was
killed the rebels charged on our left, and it was said to be the
hardest battle that was fought while we were at Atlanta.</p>

<p>Next morning we were ordered around to the extreme right
of Atlanta, to tear up the railroad between Atlanta and Jonesboro.
Our regiment was the first to reach the railroad. We
took the rails off the cross ties and bent them, piled the cross
ties on top of the rails and set them on fire. Two trains came
up from the South, making their way to Atlanta, but discovered
that the railroad was torn up, and backed out and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>On the sixth day of August we were about the center of
the army, and were ordered to advance on the rebel works.
There was an old field between our forces and the rebels. They
had fortified on a ridge as usual, in the woods about three hundred
yards from this old field, and they had cut down all the
small timber in front of their works, the tops falling in our direction.
They had sharpened the ends of the timber, forming
an abbatis, of which we were not aware until we had reached
within about twenty yards of their works. Some of our men
succeeded in getting through these sharp limbs and up to their
works, although they were killing our men by the dozen. Our
color-bearer, a boy by the name of John Fancher, placed the
flag on the rebel works, and they got hold of it and pulled him
in. He was never heard of again until after the war, when the
rebel records showed that he died in prison.</p>

<p>We had to fall back, leaving our dead and wounded on the
ground. We lost ninety-three men wounded and killed out of
our regiment. The officers who were killed were Capt. Bowers,
Lieut. Johnson and Lieut. Fitzgerald. Lieut. Bible and Lieut.
Walker were wounded.</p>

<p>There were five killed and wounded in my company. One
of them, George Ricker, was killed in the fight and laid close
to the edge of the old field. His mess-mate, William Smith,
saw him lying dead as we fell back. After the battle was over,
though the sharpshooters were still firing, Smith asked me to
let him go back and get the body, and help bring it off the
field. I said to him it was dangerous for him to go, but he insisted
and I finally consented. He went to where Ricker was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
and just as he stooped down to raise him up a ball struck him
in the side, and he fell dead on the body of his comrade. They
were warm friends in life, and in death were not separated.
Afterward the dead were buried, and the wounded cared for.</p>

<p>On the night of September 1, 1864, the rebels set fire to
the arsenal and all the military implements in Atlanta, and it
seemed the whole earth trembled with the explosions. The
rebels evacuated the city, moving out southeast, and on the
morning of September 2d our forces took possession, thus gaining
the victory after a siege lasting over a month.</p>

<p>Next morning we followed the rebels to Jonesboro and had
a hard battle, defeating them. After the battle was over we
remained there for a few days, and then returned to Atlanta.</p>

<p>The rebel regiment that I was urged to make up in my
county, heretofore mentioned, was captured in the Jonesboro
fight, losing quite heavily in killed and wounded. Some of the
men learned that my regiment was in the battle, and heard
that I was there, and they sent for me. I found that fifteen or
twenty of the boys with whom I had gone to school were prisoners,
and several had been killed. Some of these were boys
I had played with when we were children. I make this statement
to show that fathers and brothers and neighbors and
friends had fought against each other. This regiment that I
speak of was paroled and went back to East Tennessee, and
never returned to the rebel army.</p>

<p>After the war we were all good friends and good citizens.
These boys went into the rebel army at the beginning of the
war in 1861, and did not stay around home to rob and kill
Union men, and hang them for their money.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> this closing chapter I desire to give some incidents, etc.,
pathetic, humorous and otherwise, associated with but not
included in this somewhat disconnected and rambling account
of my varied experiences.</p>

<p>The noble and patriotic women in East Tennessee, whose
untold sufferings would fill a volume, most of whom have now
passed beyond that bourne from whence no traveler ever returns,
should have their names and deeds so far as possible
recorded so that generations yet to come may honor them and
reverence their memory.</p>

<p>No night was too dark, no danger too imminent, no task
too arduous for these self-sacrificing women to perform when
the opportunity was presented to them to lend a helping hand
to the hunted, starving Union men.</p>

<p>What brave, loving mothers, wives and sisters of East Tennessee,
who faced the tempests of hatred and persecution during
the Civil War; whose willing hands were always ready to
minister to the suffering and distressed; who carried food to
the hunted and perishing Union men who wore the homespun
clothes wrought by their own hands; who through waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
years never faltered in love and faith and duty to friend or to
country!</p>

<p>The deeds of the loyal men of East Tennessee, could they
have been told individually in all their thrilling details and
sufferings while they were living, would rival in patriotic interest
the stories of Robert Bruce, William Wallace, or the brave
Leonidas, who with his three hundred Spartans held the pass
at Thermopylae against the hosts of Persian aggressors.</p>

<p>I recall another little incident that occurred in my travels
from my home to my father’s, near Newport, Tenn. About
midway on the route that I travelled, on the main road leading
to Paint Rock, N. C., there lived a man by the name of John
Hawk, who had two or three large bull dogs. I had travelled
several times over this route, passing within two hundred yards
of his house, and had never been molested by these dogs, for I
was careful about making any noise. On one occasion I got too
near the house, and happened to step on a stick in my path,
which snapped loudly and the dogs heard it and started for me,
yelping as they ran. I was fast on foot at that time, but the
dogs seemed to be gaining on me. I looked for a tree to climb,
but they were all too large. I knew the time was coming for
me to make a fight for my life, for they were getting dangerously
near. I picked up two knotty rocks as I ran, and soon
reached a high cross fence that had been built in the woods.
Beside the fence stood a small hickory tree, and I climbed up
about ten feet just as the dogs reached the place. It was so
dark I could hardly see them. They reared up and commenced
barking as if they had treed a coon or a possum. I drew back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
with one of the stones and struck one of the dogs squarely in
the mouth, and I heard his teeth shatter. He raised a howl
and ran away, with the other dog after him. After that time
I kept that house at a greater distance. That night I made my
way home, or in other words, to the mountains close by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Uncle David’s Prayer.</span>—This prayer was delivered by
an old colored man before we crossed the Holston River. We
found him living in a little log cabin on a farm. He was an
old-fashioned preacher, and of course a Union man.</p>

<p>“O Lord God A’mighty! We is yo’ chil’n an’ ’spects you
to hea’ us widout delay, cause we all is in right smart ob a
hurry! Dese yer gemmen has run’d away from de Seceshers
and dere ’omes, and wants to get to de Norf. Dey hasn’t got
any time for to wait! Ef it is ’cording to de destination ob
great Hebben to help ’em, it’ll be ’bout necessary fo’ de help
to come right soon! De hounds an’ de rebels is on dere track!
Take de smell out ob de dogs’ noses, O Lord! and let Gypshun
darkness come ober de eysights ob de rebels. Confound ’em,
O Lord! Dey is cruel, and makes haste to shed blood. Dey
has long ’pressed de black man an’ groun’ him in de dust, an’
now I reck’n dey ’spects dat dey am a gwin’ to serve de loyal
men de same way. Help dese gemmen in time ob trouble, an’
left ’em fru all danger on to de udder side ob Jo’dan dry shod!
An’ raise de radiance ob yo’ face on all de loyal men what’s

fru de Red Sea ob Flickshun into de promis’ land! Send some
great Gen’ral ob de Norf wid his comp’ny sweepin’ down fru
dese yer parts to scare de rebels till dey flee like de Midians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
an’ slew dereselves to sabe dere lives! O Lord! bless de Gen’rals
ob de Norf! O Lord! bless de Kunnels! O Lord! bless
de Capt’ins! O Lord! bless der loyal men makin’ dere way to
de promis’ land! O Lord, Eberlastin’! Amen.”</p>

<p>This prayer, offered in a full and fervent voice, seemed to
cover our case exactly, and we could join in the “amen.” We
then crossed the Holston River, but not dry shod.</p>

<p>Some time in 1862 the loyal men of Cocke County, East
Tennessee, refused to go into the rebel army. They lived in
what was called the Knobs. There were about four hundred
of these men, some farmers, some mechanics and some blacksmiths,
all loyal to the Government.</p>

<p>Leadbeater with his command was sent to Parrottsville, in
the same county, and went into camp for the purpose of looking
after these men, who had built breastworks on a high hill
in that locality. They sawed off gum tree logs about the length
of a cannon, and bored out holes in these logs large enough to
load with tin cans full of large bullets and pieces of iron. They
made iron bands out of wagon tires, and put them around the
log cannons to keep them from exploding when fired. It was
said that they could fire these wooden guns with accuracy.</p>

<p>The rebels heard of these preparations, and with a large
force went into this Knob country and found the works, and
captured about one hundred of these men and brought them
to Parrottsville, where the army was in camp. They put them
into a large one-story frame school-house, and placed a heavy
guard around the prison, They kept them there for some time
and treated them like brutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>A man by the name of Hamilton Yett, who was a strong
rebel, came into the prison and said he wanted “to look at the
animals!” Such an expression from a man enraged the prisoners,
and one of them, named Peter Reece, picked up a piece
of brick from an old fire-place and threw it at Yett, striking
him on the head and fracturing his skull. In a few minutes
the soldiers came in the prison and took Reece out and hung
him to a tree close to the prison, where he hung for three days.
His wife and other women came and took the body down and
hauled it away, no man being allowed to assist them.</p>

<p>Some of the men who were in this prison were taken to
Tuscaloosa, some made their escape, and some were killed while
trying to escape. There was a man by the name of Philip
Bewley, who was a Methodist preacher, a good man and as
strong a Union man as there was in East Tennessee. While
in this prison he would pray for the success of the North and
for the men who were with him in prison. He lived until after
the war.</p>

<p>In this connection a little incident that occurred after the
war may not be out of place in this small volume.</p>

<p>There was in our regiment a man by the name of Walker,
who had one of his eyes shot out in the campaign in Georgia.
When the war was over he came home, studied for the ministry
and became a noted preacher.</p>

<p>In 1867 there was a big revival in the same town, Parrottsville,
about three hundred yards from the old school-house in
which Bewley and the other Union men were confined and
where Reece was hung. While the revival was going on one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
night at the church, Walker was praying the Lord to guide and
direct the people in the way they ought to go, and that all
might get to Heaven; Bewley rose up and said,</p>

<p>“Yes, thank the Lord, Brother Walker; there will be no
rebels up there to shoot our eyes out!”</p>

<p>I heard this myself, and was not surprised, for he was the
wittiest man I ever heard. It raised no excitement, for it was
just after the war and prejudice was running high at that time;
but, thank God, the war has been ended for forty-five years,
and the North and the South have united, and we are now one
people, one Nation, under one flag.</p>
